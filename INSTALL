First you MUST compile the original SWIFT package - get the swift.tar.gz
file from the web site:

http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/swift.html

uncompress it and follow the instructions in the README.first file therein.

Uncompress the swift_mvs2_fp_ye_YORP.tar.gz package to a SEPARATE
directory. You then need to copy or symlink the resulting libswift.a
library to this directory (where the swift_mvs2_fp_ye_YORP source
files are located).

BEWARE! The swift.inc file included here should correspond to that
of in the swift/ directory! CHECK CONSISTENCY, otherwise 'core dumps'
may occur which is always unfortunate. Finally, check and possibly
edit the Makefile and run:

make

The resulting executables are located in the main/ directory.

Almost all code is written in FORTRAN77 language and thus it can be
easily compiled for various platforms and operating systems. We provide
a Makefile suitable for the GNU/Linux gcc compiler, but in the past,
we compiled the integrator for other operating systems too.

If something fails, you can try to copy the files into the original
SWIFT directory and compile manually. However, this approach may
somewhat "dangerous", because we had to modify some of the original
subroutines.

Secondly, one has to be careful when increasing the numbers
(of objects) in swift.inc, because we need to allocate large arrays
to accumulate orbital-elements data for the digital filters.
