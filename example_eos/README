These input files were used to simulate the long-term evolution
of the the Eos family (Broz & Morbidelli 2013).

BEWARE! There was more than 6000 test particles in original input
files, while there is only 2000 TPs in a standard swift.inc file.
Anyway, that job was split (using scipts) to 33 subdirectories
and then computed on 33 CPUs to save a (life) time...
