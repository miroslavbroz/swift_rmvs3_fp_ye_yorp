The computation of the YORP torques (included in this package!)
is described in:

  Icarus, 172, 526, 2004.

There is also a digital filter to compute proper elemets, which uses
a subroutine written by D. Nesvorny:

  and its applications to asteroids, Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astron., 65, 137, 1996.

The analytical theory used to compute diurnal and seaonal variants
of the Yarkovsky effects:

(I am sorry for this excessively-long list of references,
but several people contributed substantially to this code.
Would you be so kind and cite at least first three?)


We shall not forget to mention the original SWIFT integrator too:
