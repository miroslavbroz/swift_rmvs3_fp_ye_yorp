Oct 8th 2013
	A public up-to-date (!) documentation was created for all
        new parts of the code.

2011-2012
        The YORP-effect evolution of the spin axis was also added.
        (It should be now possible to fit the "ears" of asteroid families
        on their semimajor axis a vs absolute magnitude H plots.)

Apr 30th 2008
	There was an error in prop_sigma2.f - averiging was over the
	entire integration, not only over the limited window.

Feb 14th 2008
	A rewrite of the code, the files were put in different
	directories, the Makefile was modified accordingly.

Jul 25th 2006
	io_write_filter.f routines now filter a user defined
	slow variable: sigma = (p+q)/q*lambda_PL - p/q*lambda_TP
	- varpi_TP. See the three new options in filter.in.
	It is used also in io_write_proper.f (and modified
	proper.in accordingly), to produce a nice smooth resonant
	elements, especially suitable for Hildas, where large
	oscillations exist with period shorter than that of libration.

Nov 30th 2004
	FMFT routines now calclulate also planetary frequencies
	(what is necessary for the analyses of secular resonances).

Dec 8th 2003
	An important correction in FMFT filter of inclination
	for the case, when filtering window was larger than output
	timestep. A new option in proper.in, which switches
	on automatic detection of interruptions (spaces)
	in input buffer.

Nov 11th 2003
	A few options to proper elements filter were added -
	a selection of proper frequencies by a given (narrower)
	range of g and s and possibly a vectorial sum of all
	valid frequencies.

Sep 30th 2003
	Corrected error in Makefile, which caused compilation
	of the swift_mvs2_fp_y program without Yarkovsky acceleration.
	An updated swiftcont script for restarts of SWIFT jobs.

Jun 11th 2003
	A new version of swiftcont script for an automatic restart
	of SWIFT jobs.

May 12th 2003
	Calculate e, inc again from h,k,p,q, because proper elements
        are calculted from these and we need proper elements
	to be reproducible (!) by propoff program.

Apr 23rd 2003
	Statement save sigmalast, prop_elmts, prop_time was missing
	in io_write_proper.f code! On SGI Irix architecture it lead
	to incorrect output resonant elements. There was also an
	interchanged real*4 and real*8 write in io_write_proper.f,
	namely in filter type 4.

Apr 9th 2003
	Corrected declaration of istat(,) array in io_write_fmft.f.

Apr 8th 2003
	A new option in filter.in and proper.in files were added
	- write real*8 bin.filter.dat and bin.proper.dat files.
	Corresponding changes had to be made in io_init_filter.f,
	io_write_filter.f, io_init_proper.f, io_write_proper.f.

Apr 4th 2003
	Driver files swift_*.f were renamed (according to a scheme
        swift_integrator_filter_nongrav.forces).

Mar 25th 2003
	Corrected dimensions of Fortran arrays in fmft.c function.
	(They should be EXACTLY the same as in `proper.inc' file.)

Sep 20th 2000
	io_write_filter.f: Changed the angle in the definition of
	h, k from peri to varpi (which has a longer period of
	circulation). I use a separate direct filtering of e, inc
	instead of calculation from h,k,p,q.
